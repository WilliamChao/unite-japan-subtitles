1
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:52,010
Hello, it's very good to see all of you here today.

2
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:55,880
My name is Na'Tosha Bard.

3
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,100
I am a lead software developer at Unity.

4
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:07,070
Originally I'm from America, but about three years ago
I moved to Copenhagen, Denmark to work for Unity.

5
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:14,900
Now as a software developer for Unity, I
work on a lot of many different things,

6
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,939
but the reason why I'm here today

7
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:19,839
is because i'm one of the Linux
platform developers.

8
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:24,969
And i'm going to talk to you about Linux publishing in Unity 4.

9
00:02:24,969 --> 00:02:28,430
This presentation is going
to be probably a bit shorter

10
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,049
then the rest that you've seen.

11
00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:35,440
I'm gonna first cover a
brief introduction to Linux

12
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,059
for those who may have not used it
before and are wondering what it is.

13
00:02:41,059 --> 00:02:44,750
Then we're going to talk a bit about about the
state of gaming on Linux

14
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,459
in the past and today.

15
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:57,913
And then finally I want to talk specifically
about the Linux export feature in Unity 4.

16
00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:02,759
So I would actually like to get to know
you a bit better before we begin, so I'm

17
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:06,959
going to ask a couple of
questions to the audience.

18
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,809
First of all,

19
00:03:08,809 --> 00:03:11,249
how many people in here personally

20
00:03:11,249 --> 00:03:18,249
use or have used Linux, could
you just raise your hand?

21
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:25,040
OK, that's a higher number than I
expected. So that makes me very happy.

22
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,150
Second of all, how many of you either
already are or are planning to

23
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,759
publish your game onto
the Windows or Mac

24
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:35,566
desktop, in addition
to any other platforms

25
00:03:35,592 --> 00:03:40,399
that you already are publishing to

26
00:03:43,499 --> 00:03:47,209
So let's get started.

27
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:50,579
Now first of all, what is Linux?

28
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:53,349
This may be a bit redundant for

29
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:56,849
those of you that have used it before
but they are some people I could see

30
00:03:56,849 --> 00:04:02,569
in the audience that haven't
so I will cover this section.

31
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:05,959
Linux is a Unix like operating system

32
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:12,109
and it's the third most popular operating
system in the world behind Mac OSX.

33
00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:17,269
The defining characteristic of
Linux is the Linux kernel.

34
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:20,459
And all of the software on
top of the Linux kernel

35
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:24,839
can come from anywhere
and be developed by anybody.

36
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:29,869
The main user space tools and applications
come from what is known as the GNU project.

37
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,419
The most unique characteristic of Linux

38
00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:43,139
is the fact that it's open source.

39
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:49,349
In fact it is it is one of the most prominent examples
of free and open source software collaboration.

40
00:04:49,349 --> 00:04:56,990
And this is one of the reasons why, I personally,
am very, very passionate about Linux and have been

41
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:02,830
a Linux user for many many years. Long
before I ever came to work for Unity.

42
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:07,360
The fact that it is open source means
that the underlying source code

43
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:14,999
can be used, modified, or distributed
either commercially or non-commercially

44
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:21,810
by anyone under an applicable license.

45
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,349
Now this open source nature of Linux

46
00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:30,099
has led to the creation and distribution
of a huge number of Linux distributions.

47
00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:34,810
Some of the most popular of these distributions
are represented here on this side

48
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:43,690
You can see distributions like Ubuntu,
Debian and Fedora and several others.

49
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:48,500
A Linux distribution will be a packaged
installer or a live boot disk consisting

50
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:55,029
of the Linux kernel and usually a set of
libraries and utilities from the GNU  project.

51
00:05:55,029 --> 00:06:01,129
Graphics support for desktop distributions
is provided by the X-Window system.

52
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:03,809
Some distributions are commercially backed,

53
00:06:03,809 --> 00:06:06,960
such as Ubuntu, Red Hat and openSUSE,

54
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,149
and other distributions are community driven.

55
00:06:11,149 --> 00:06:20,400
Obviously both commercially backed and community
driven distributions have been quite successful.

56
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,530
Linux has been ported to more platforms
than any other operating system.

57
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:28,090
And distributions exist not only for the
desktop but for servers for mobile

58
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:31,599
phones, for embedded systems
and many other platforms.

59
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:37,929
Many of the devices of course that are around you
everyday are actually running Linux internally,

60
00:06:37,929 --> 00:06:44,052
but the environments that are most interesting for
gaming are the desktop and server platforms.

61
00:06:44,078 --> 00:06:48,429
So that's what we'll focus on for
the rest of this talk.

62
00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:55,535
One other bit of exciting news
for Linux is that recently

63
00:06:55,561 --> 00:07:00,590
China announced Ubuntu as its
state endorsed operating system.

64
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:04,089
Canonical, which is Ubuntu’s
commercial backer

65
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:08,939
is working alongside the Chinese ministry
of industry and information technology

66
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:12,289
to bring a suitable Ubuntu version to China.

67
00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:16,819
So that's just what I believe to be an interesting

68
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:21,449
thing to note about the
state of Linux today.

69
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:27,300
And now I want to cover just a few technical
facts about Linux for those who may not not know.

70
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,300
The Linux Kernel is written in
the programming language C.

71
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,490
Probably most people have heard that

72
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:41,129
the kernel was originally released by a man
named Linus Torvalds who is from Finland,

73
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:49,900
but due to the open source nature of Linux,
he is only the author of about 2% of

74
00:07:49,900 --> 00:08:00,059
the kernel code now. The other 98% has been
written by open-source contributors around the world.

75
00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:05,220
Linux is much more popular in
the server space, most definitely,

76
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,650
but desktop usage is growing steadily.

77
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:14,050
For rendering Linux uses
OpenGL just like Mac OSX,

78
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:17,909
while Windows of course uses is Direct3D.

79
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:22,229
One interesting characteristic of Linux is that

80
00:08:22,255 --> 00:08:27,089
server-based installs often
have no GUI whatsoever.

81
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:33,170
This is relevant for gaming because that
means applications that were designed

82
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:41,890
to run specifically on a desktop are in many cases not
going to be able to run out of the box on the server.

83
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:48,830
And then another interesting, what I believe to be
an interesting fact about Linux is that it is run on 90% of the

84
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,510
world's supercomputers.

85
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:57,900
One of these supercomputers is owned
by a company called Weta Digital.

86
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:02,040
Weta Digital used their Linux cluster which
was running, I believe, Red Hat Linux

87
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,480
for the creation of the film Avatar.

88
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:19,424
So we're seeing recently how Linux is becoming more and
more important in the area of digital content creation.

89
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:25,050
So now that we've had a brief overview
and an introduction to Linux itself,

90
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:28,770
let's go over a very brief
history of gaming on Linux,

91
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:35,770
and then we'll talk about the state of gaming on Linux
today and how that is relevant to Unity developers.

92
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:42,150
Historically, Linux hasn't been seen as what we
would think of as a serious gaming platform.

93
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:46,230
It shared a lot of history with
the Unix gaming scene,

94
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:52,220
and commercial support for Linux started in
the early nineties with the release of Doom.

95
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:56,715
Although we saw a steady
stream of open source games

96
00:09:56,741 --> 00:10:03,790
and a few proprietary titles released over the
years, it's taken a long time for Linux to start

97
00:10:03,816 --> 00:10:08,670
being seen as a platform
worth targeting.

98
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:16,900
There are a couple of reasons for why
this transition has happened so slowly.

99
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:26,470
In particular their are a few notable
stumbling blocks that I will discuss briefly.

100
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:32,800
The first one is a historical lack
of good graphics drivers.

101
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,010
Several years ago all graphics drivers
for Linux had to be developed by reverse

102
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:43,080
engineering the proprietary drivers for Windows.

103
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,910
These drivers in many cases didn't work
very well, particularly for gaming.

104
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:53,160
Not only because they would have a lot of bugs
and a lot of instabilities, but because they

105
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:58,259
couldn't take full advantage of the features
of the graphics card in the same way that

106
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:02,630
a proprietary driver would be able to.

107
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:06,069
Now luckily for us, this
situation has changed,

108
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:10,560
and we now have proprietary
drivers being supplied directly by

109
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:20,435
AMD, Intel and Nvidia--the predominant
graphics card manufacturers.

110
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:29,140
Another common historical
stumbling block

111
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:32,670
is a a concern that
has always existed

112
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:38,490
about supporting a large
number of Linux distributions.

113
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:42,050
They've always been concerns,
even within Unity technologies,

114
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:49,520
about how it could actually be possible to
support so many different Linux distributions.

115
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:58,030
You can see here a graph of the split
of Linux distributions up through 2011.

116
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:01,340
So this data is about two years old,

117
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:06,890
but you can see a huge number of Linux
distributions that are still active today.

118
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,690
For those who don't know, Linux distributions

119
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:17,430
can generally be grouped
into three groups, and

120
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:21,220
the difference between
these three groups

121
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:26,670
revolves around the package
management system.

122
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:31,450
And when I say package management system,
I'm speaking about the system that is

123
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:36,633
used for actually
bundling and distributing

124
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:41,110
and installing
applications and tools.

125
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:45,220
This graph shows that we have

126
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,930
three primary groups
of Linux distributions.

127
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:52,680
One, which is shown on the top are Debian
based distributions and for package management

128
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:57,710
they use what we call "deb packages."

129
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:02,760
The bottom group are what we call "Red Hat"
or "rpm based" distributions,

130
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:08,520
and for package management
they use rpm packages.

131
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,800
And then the middle group are what
we call source based distributions,

132
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,510
and the way that these distributions
solve the problem of package management

133
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:21,580
is by downloading, compiling and
installing all applications and tools

134
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:29,279
directly from source. So we see
a large number of distributions,

135
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,500
and there are some differences between them.

136
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:38,670
But the good thing here, is that these various
distributions are all fundamentally the same.

137
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:41,640
They will run the same Linux kernel,

138
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:45,780
they're all going to have a C++ runtime,

139
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:50,200
and they will use X11 for input
and window management.

140
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,760
So even though it looks like a very
difficult problem to solve,

141
00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:04,500
the problem is not actually
as big as one would think.

142
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,350
Another likely reason that Linux hasn't
been targeted as a serious gaming platform

143
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:14,910
is a concern that Linux users won't
actually pay for commercial games.

144
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:22,040
This has always been a concern and
it's also a never-ending cycle,

145
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:27,010
because historically very few commercial
vendors have brought games to Linux and so

146
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,749
we've had very little data

147
00:14:28,749 --> 00:14:33,460
to indicate whether or not there actually
is a commercial market for Linux.

148
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:40,100
Because of that people have not shipped
more games for Linux and then we

149
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:45,680
still can gather data and this is just
continued over the years.

150
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:51,230
In the years past we have seen a few games
that were shipped commercially for Linux

151
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:54,260
turn out to be very, very successful.

152
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,140
And more recently initiatives like the
Humble Indie Bundle

153
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,230
have indicated that the demand for

154
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:02,670
commercial games on Linux is growing and
it's not as insignificant as we once thought.

155
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:15,670
so knowing this, let's talk about the
current state of gaming on Linux.

156
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:21,120
In 2012, two significant things
happened for gaming on Linux.

157
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,190
First of all, Valve announced
Steam support for Linux,

158
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:31,310
and second of all Unity announced
Linux runtime support.

159
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:36,670
Steam support for Linux was
announced in July of 2012

160
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:40,570
and Valve shipped a beta
client in December of 2012.

161
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:43,069
Official support for Linux
in the Steam client

162
00:15:43,069 --> 00:15:48,050
was released in February of this year,
so not very long ago.

163
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,120
Linux runtime support in Unity

164
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,910
launched with a game called Rochard and Humble Indie Bundle 6.

165
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:58,160
Since then games like Splice and Snuggle Truck,

166
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,840
which are some well known Unity games,

167
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,230
have followed in later Humble Indie Bundles.

168
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:09,180
And other Unity games for Linux have shown
up on other distribution platforms as well.

169
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:20,805
I will go over the current set of distribution
platforms available for Linux in a minute.

170
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:25,890
In 2013, Linux continues to grow.

171
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:33,540
This year a minimum of fifty million computers
will ship with Ubuntu Linux pre-installed.

172
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:38,260
Linux market share on the desktop is
something that is really hard to estimate.

173
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:43,230
it's definitely small, especially compared
to the market share of Windows,

174
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,850
but it is growing.

175
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:50,580
From 2008 to 2009 alone, Linux
market share calculated

176
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:58,210
via web browser analytics,
rose from 1.3 to 2.2%,

177
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:06,080
but the browser-based estimation is primarily
a North American based web measurement.

178
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:10,761
So it's not believed to be a good indicator

179
00:17:10,787 --> 00:17:15,230
of what is happening in the entire world.

180
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:19,380
Linux has a much higher penetration
in non-North American markets

181
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:29,885
and it's actually estimated to be as high as between
eight and twelve percent in some Asian countries.

182
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:38,440
Next, I would like to cover a few of the
top distribution methods for Linux

183
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:43,130
because after we released
Linux runtime support

184
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:46,480
one of the most common
questions we actually got was,

185
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,740
"It's fantastic that I can publish my
game for Linux now, but I have no idea

186
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:59,740
how to actually ship it to
potential customers."

187
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:07,150
The most successful distribution
method for Linux is Steam.

188
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:13,080
Steam for Linux launched publicly in
February of this year, as I mentioned earlier.

189
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:18,580
Statistics from March show that about 2%
of all Steam users are on some variant of Linux,

190
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:24,500
compared to about 3%
on some version of Mac OSX.

191
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:29,180
One thing to note is that many Unity
games actually getting into Steam via

192
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:32,440
a program called Steam Green Light.

193
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,269
For those who don't know,
Steam Greenlight is a system

194
00:18:35,269 --> 00:18:38,919
where Valve uses community voting
as a mechanism to determine what

195
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:45,860
additional games should
actually go on Steam.

196
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:50,400
Another easy distribution method
is the Ubuntu software center.

197
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,990
The Ubuntu Software Center is an  App store for Ubuntu.

198
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:57,540
The nice thing about the Ubuntu Software Center is that Canonical

199
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:01,790
offers a free packaging service
that will package the raw binary

200
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:05,610
output from Unity into a Dev package.

201
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:13,250
We talked a bit earlier about how some
distributions, like Ubuntu, are commercially backed.

202
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,549
in this case Canonical is
Ubuntu's commercial backer

203
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:22,049
and provides financial support for the
development of the operating system.

204
00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:26,010
And then we also talked
earlier about how

205
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:30,090
different Linux distributions have
different package management systems,

206
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:35,600
and one of the prominent package
management systems is a system

207
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,730
that uses what we call "dev packages,"

208
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:41,860
and Ubuntu is one of those systems.

209
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,810
The free packaging service from Canonical

210
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:48,260
and submission to the Ubuntu Software
center can be accessed by going to

211
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:55,260
developer.ubuntu.com and just
setting up a free account.

212
00:19:57,299 --> 00:20:00,620
Desura is another digital
distribution platform.

213
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:05,520
It has clients for Windows, for OSX, and for Linux.

214
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,570
It tends to cater to smaller indy
developers, who are not large enough

215
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:15,120
or not yet large enough to be able
to negotiate deals with Steam.

216
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,450
There's not really much else to say
except that it is very straightforward.

217
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:26,870
And when I've spoken to some of the people
that have founded Desura, they told me

218
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:32,390
about how games that have a
Linux port sell significantly better

219
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:39,390
then the games that don't
have a Linux port.

220
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:44,179
And then finally, The Humble
Indie Bundle is very, very popular,

221
00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:51,529
and many of the bundles have done
over one million US dollars.

222
00:20:51,529 --> 00:20:59,580
And together the 21 completed bundles
have done over 33.2 million US dollars.

223
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:03,640
Often games are scouted
for these bundles, meaning

224
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:10,580
that the organization that compiles
and ships the Humble Indie Bundle

225
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:16,059
will approach developers asking
if their game could be included.

226
00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:20,390
But if you would like to submit your
game to them for consideration,

227
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:26,900
all you need to do is go to their
website and fill out the submission form.

228
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,530
The Linux developers at Unity

229
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:33,980
in particular are very
happy to work with

230
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:39,440
any game developers that are trying
to get their game ready specifically for

231
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,980
the Humble Indie Bundle.

232
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,740
Oftentimes when game developers
are using this, this is the first time

233
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:49,750
that they've ever shipped a game for Linux
so they have a lot of unanswered questions or

234
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:56,130
potentially can run in into problems.

235
00:21:56,130 --> 00:22:07,370
Now next I want to discuss the export feature
that it exists in Unity 4 for exporting to Linux.

236
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:15,230
In Unity 4 you can export your game to Linux in the
same way that you can with Windows and Mac OSX.

237
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:19,210
The export feature is available in both
Unity free and in Unity pro.

238
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:25,120
We don't require an extra license
in order to use it.

239
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,080
Actually building the player is very, very simple.

240
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,230
In Unity 4 the build settings
window now shows

241
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:38,950
Linux next to the Windows and
Mac stand-alone targets.

242
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:44,190
If you select Linux as the target platform, you'll
have three different options for architectures:

243
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:51,570
One is for X86 which will produce binaries
suitable for 32-bit architectures,

244
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:59,560
One will be X86-64 which will produce
binaries suitable for 64-bit architectures,

245
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:06,080
and then finally there is what
we have called a universal target

246
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:13,370
which will contain the game data and the
player binaries for both architectures.

247
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:18,610
The system requirements for a desktop
Unity game on Linux are very, very simple.

248
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:21,210
There's three main things that the user will need.

249
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:29,059
One is a C++ runtime, which the user is guaranteed to
have if they have any tools or applications installed.

250
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:33,299
They need to have a machine
with 32 or 64-bit architecture.

251
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:45,779
So some kind of an ARM platform, for example,
won't be able to run the Unity player.

252
00:23:45,779 --> 00:23:49,190
And then finally they
need a graphics card

253
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:56,190
and drivers that will provide
hardware acceleration.

254
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:04,290
Additionally in Unity 4.2, which is currently under
development, there is a headless mode option.

255
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:10,350
This option will produce 32-bit or 64-bit
binaries designed for headless servers.

256
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,320
I spoke earlier about how Linux installations

257
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:20,120
are different oftentimes on the server
that they are on the desktop

258
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:25,880
and on the server they don't have any kind of a UI.

259
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:32,190
So if for example you
want to use the player

260
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:36,773
for a network server for
a multiplayer based game

261
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,990
for example, and that
server is running Linux

262
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:47,130
and it is a headless install of Linux then you'll
want to build a player with its headless mode option.

263
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:51,030
That's exactly what it was intended for.

264
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:53,929
These players will start up
automatically in batch mode.

265
00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:57,090
They don't require running X11
session they don't even require running

266
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:03,669
X11 install in order to work, so if you've
installed a standard Linux server distribution,

267
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:08,060
then the headless player will
just work out of the box.

268
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:16,000
In fact the only system requirement for the headless
player is simply a C++ runtime.

269
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,190
So that covers of how you can
very easily export your game.

270
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:24,360
In terms of distribution support at Unity, we offer

271
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:30,390
what we're calling official support for
Ubuntu Linux version 10.10 or later.

272
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:35,350
The reason why Ubuntu was chosen is
because it has by far the highest

273
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:42,620
desktop market share amongst
Linux distributions.

274
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:49,669
But the player actually runs without problems
on a very, very wide range of Linux desktops.

275
00:25:49,669 --> 00:25:54,030
Our analytics showed right after we
released it that people were running it on

276
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:58,029
everything from a Ubuntu to Linux Mint to Arch Linux,

277
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:06,750
a huge number of Linux distributions that I
didn't actually even expect people to be using.

278
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:13,429
So users should not be afraid of filing
bugs found on any distribution of Linux.

279
00:26:13,429 --> 00:26:18,899
And of course we give preference
to addressing issues on

280
00:26:18,899 --> 00:26:25,899
Ubuntu specifically, but we're happy
to look at any bugs that you file.

281
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,930
Next I will cover a couple of tips
for developing Unity games for Linux

282
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:37,760
that I've personally
found important.

283
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,510
On some machines

284
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:46,669
there is a Compiz is setting. Compiz is
used by most compositing window managers.

285
00:26:46,669 --> 00:26:52,890
The default desktop on Ubuntu for example,
relies on Compiz and many others do as well.

286
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:57,659
And in Compiz there's a setting called
"unredirect fullscreen windows."

287
00:26:57,659 --> 00:27:02,080
In many cases the setting
is not turned on.

288
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:07,370
The setting allows, when
applications are in full screen,

289
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:14,590
for the drawing on full-screen windows to
not be redirected to off-screen pics maps.

290
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:21,110
So for any 3D application the setting
will significantly affect performance.

291
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:26,559
Sometimes not having it on can actually
affect the frame rate up to fifty percent.

292
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,660
So it should always be turned on.

293
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:35,190
We've talked to the developers
of Ubuntu and in their

294
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:38,810
12.10 release, which came out
in Fall of this last year,

295
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:41,179
the setting is now on by default,

296
00:27:41,179 --> 00:27:47,910
but in previous versions of Ubuntu it was not
on it may not be on on other distributions.

297
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:52,649
So if there is any kind of a performance
problem this is the first thing

298
00:27:52,649 --> 00:27:57,549
that developers should look for.

299
00:27:57,549 --> 00:28:01,290
And then next is related to
the Build Player Pipeline.

300
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:04,549
Because there's no editor
available for Linux

301
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:08,769
you have to edit and build your Linux
game on Windows or Mac OSX.

302
00:28:08,769 --> 00:28:12,260
One thing that speeds up this process
for me is to use a post-process build step

303
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:18,990
that automatically copies my build player
from OSX or Windows to my Linux machine.

304
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:23,221
I personally do this with
an editor script and it's

305
00:28:23,247 --> 00:28:27,289
a very simple very
straightforward editor script.

306
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:33,279
In this example a directory on
my Linux machine is mounted

307
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:40,350
as a share on my OSX
installation, but you could

308
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:44,621
modify this to simply copy with

309
00:28:44,647 --> 00:28:49,580
SFTP or SSH without much trouble.

310
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:53,150
You can find out more information
about post-process built steps if

311
00:28:53,150 --> 00:29:00,610
you don't know in our online documentation
and I've included the link to the specific

312
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:06,880
page that is relevant for this example on this slide.

313
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:14,590
And now finally we have a few things that are either
done but not yet released or are in development

314
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,110
that I want to share with you.

315
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:18,669
These things include headless mode,

316
00:29:18,669 --> 00:29:21,120
which I previously mentioned is

317
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,880
going to be releasing in Unity 4.2,

318
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,639
and webcam support

319
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:30,460
which will also be released in Unity 4.2.

320
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:33,850
One of the things we want to work on

321
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:37,850
in the future, is better
Steam integration.

322
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:41,669
A lot of our users have
had a lot of trouble

323
00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:44,940
integrating with Steam's
APIs and libraries,

324
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:50,570
so we would like to make that
process as easy as it can be.

325
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:58,059
And then finally we want to spend some
time optimizing for open-source drivers.

326
00:29:58,059 --> 00:30:03,610
I don't believe they will ever be
able to provide, or always provide

327
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:09,430
the same user experience with open-source
drivers as we can with proprietary drivers,

328
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:16,515
but we haven't really optimized it all and I think
that's one area that we can improve on a lot.

329
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:29,660
So at this point that includes all of the
content that that i've prepared to present.

330
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:36,660
Are there any questions from our audience?

331
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:44,320
(Thanks for your talk.)

332
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,870
(What about the editor? Is it coming to Linux?)

333
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:52,179
So the question is, "Is the
editor coming to Linux?"

334
00:30:52,179 --> 00:30:56,000
I get asked this question all the time
and I wish I had a better answer.

335
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,059
It is being researched.

336
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:03,180
We haven't decided either way whether
or not we actually will ship it.

337
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:11,679
A lot of it is a question for
demand and benefit for our users

338
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:17,100
as compared to the development time and more
specifically the long-term support burden.

339
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:21,029
There's obviously a significantly
larger amount of tech

340
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:24,810
that exists in the editor than
exists in the runtime,

341
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:28,740
and we also use a lot of
third-party middleware

342
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:34,700
in the editor that we
don't use in the runtime.

343
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:39,370
So there's a higher development cost there, and

344
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:41,519
we have to be sure that the benefit

345
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,540
to our users is going to be worth

346
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:47,710
committing ourselves to the
long-term support burden.

347
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:51,158
It's being researched. We
haven't decided either way.

348
00:31:51,184 --> 00:31:55,410
People who wanted and have a use case for
it, I would encourage you to make yourself

349
00:31:55,410 --> 00:32:02,070
known the Unity community
and to us as a company,

350
00:32:02,096 --> 00:32:08,730
because we take user
feedback into consideration.

351
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:15,440
(Can I ask one more? Do you make any guarantees about
which version of OpenGL will be used by the runtime on Linux?)

352
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:26,390
We haven't published any guarantees,

353
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:30,420
and I can't remember off the top of my head,

354
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:34,970
what we're assuming in the rendering pipeline.

355
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:37,690
But I would be happy to look that up for you

356
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:41,780
and contact you with that
information at a latter time.

357
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,450
(Thank you very much.)

358
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:50,450
Ok, any other questions?

359
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:58,149
(Does Unity plan to support Open GL 4
in the future?)

360
00:32:58,149 --> 00:33:01,630
Do we plan future Open GL 4 support?

361
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:08,160
It's not something that

362
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,019
we're specifically working on right now, but

363
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:17,300
I believe that we will need to
support it because eventually

364
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:21,640
it will just be a requirement for
users to be able to run our content,

365
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:28,640
not only only on Linux but also on OSX.

366
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:37,970
Any other questions?

367
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:41,630
Okay, if you'd like to speak with me
privately or if you would like to

368
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:47,350
have on my business cards in case you have
future questions feel free to come up here,

369
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:57,280
and for everyone else, arigatou gozaimasu.
