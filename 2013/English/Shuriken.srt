1
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,279
Hello, everybody.

2
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:31,489


3
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:34,390
I don't speak any Japanese, so...

4
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,660
My name is Carl Callawaert.

5
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,490
I work as a product--Closer? Okay.

6
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:44,220
I work as a product evangelist at Unity Technologies.

7
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:50,910
I perform workshops, training around
the world, mainly in the Americas.

8
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,820
I'm always happy to be here,

9
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,410
but it's still snowing where I live.

10
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,830
I live in a remote place in Canada,

11
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:01,570
so to be away from the snow is great.

12
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:05,940
Today we're going to talk
about Shruiken particles.

13
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:10,400
What I'm gonna' do, I'm gonna'
show it directly in Unity.

14
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:17,960
So I'm going to cover how to
create particles like fire, like this,

15
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,670
explosions,

16
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:27,530
and effects,

17
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:28,960
another kind of fire,

18
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,030
but I will break it down--why and how I use it.

19
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,645
Like explosion effects,

20
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:42,214
like magical effects,

21
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,300
other ones,

22
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,490
like totally different.

23
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,183
But, you will see what
I'm talking about.

24
00:01:55,209 --> 00:01:59,890
Like storms and we're
going to deal with that.

25
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,641
Other effects.

26
00:02:02,667 --> 00:02:06,270
We're going to start
with this one.

27
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:13,129
So I'm going to go back to
my Powerpoint presentation.

28
00:02:13,129 --> 00:02:18,169
So after this presentation, you
should be able to create complex

29
00:02:18,169 --> 00:02:22,479
particle systems in an
easy and fast way.

30
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:28,620
Also, some advice for you on how
to use Shuriken for mobile.

31
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:35,510
Raise your hands. Who of you
has already used Shuriken in Unity?

32
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:45,069
Raise your hands. Who has problems
sometimes creating the effect you want?

33
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,269
So first, we're going to talk about
how to create your effects.

34
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:55,000
So, for people who don't know particles,

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,729
it's just a collection of sprites
and 3D objects that are emitted.

36
00:03:01,929 --> 00:03:06,859
We can use it for
rain, smoke and fire,

37
00:03:06,859 --> 00:03:12,489
but also to show impact
or magical things.

38
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:15,540
Later on, I'm going to talk more about that,

39
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,499
but always ask why you're going to use it.

40
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:21,859
Don't start to use particles if there's no why,

41
00:03:21,859 --> 00:03:27,689
and if you can do it in another cheaper and
faster way, its more interesting sometimes.

42
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:30,309
How do I learn Shuriken?

43
00:03:31,029 --> 00:03:33,859
I used particles before, of course.

44
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:39,279
But there's a lot of particle effects
on our Asset Store you can download

45
00:03:39,279 --> 00:03:43,209
and learn from there, from the interesting ones.

46
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:47,230
I look at real particles
in life and analyze them.

47
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:53,199
I go to YouTube for that.

48
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:58,809
The problem is when you look at
Shuriken, or when you open it in Unity,

49
00:03:58,809 --> 00:04:01,979
it's a lot of parameters, a lot of sliders.

50
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:03,849
It's overwhelming.

51
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:05,889
But if you learn a slider,

52
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:09,659
never ask what that slider does.

53
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:11,589
That is useless.

54
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:15,099
Think about why I will use that slider.

55
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:19,970
This is the first essence of creating
particles or any software.

56
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:24,449
If you use buttons with
the reason "what is it?"

57
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:26,509
we call that "buttonology."

58
00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:30,729
And the knowledge of
buttons is not useful for me.

59
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:36,169
So we're going to talk about
fire and explosions, like this.

60
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:39,530
I work in four steps.

61
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:44,870
First, I define how many
particle systems I will need.

62
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,539
Then I analyze how they move,

63
00:04:47,539 --> 00:04:50,120
and then I do the colors and the materials.

64
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,500
And then the little effects
to make it magical.

65
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,919
But, mainly I'm lazy.

66
00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:02,729
I just buy the packages on
the Asset Store and I'm done.

67
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:08,400
So the question is "how many
particle systems do you use?"

68
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,529
When I look at this particle
system, I see four.

69
00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:16,820
But, I don't agree with that.

70
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,360
Why?

71
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,979
Because, when I close my eyes,

72
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:23,729
and I look really simply through my eyes,

73
00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:26,669
I see two major things.

74
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:31,380
It's the glow and the
shockwave. The light.

75
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,590
That's enough sometimes
to create the effects

76
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:37,169
instead of creating all the particles.

77
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:39,710
Especially when you do cartoons,

78
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:43,279
think about just the essence,
what you need.

79
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:46,699
The more particles you
put in your scene,

80
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:52,090
the more it becomes difficult on
your draw calls and your overdraw.

81
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:57,620
And, if you have a lot, then you
cry and you stop your production.

82
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:05,209
But let's talk about how to
create a simple fire particle.

83
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:09,400
See the glow?

84
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,279
And that's very important,
just one element of glow.

85
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:17,610
When I open my eyes a bit
more, I see the shockwave.

86
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:23,459
When I open my eyes more, I see
actually the flames, the fire.

87
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:26,840
Open more, I see smoke.

88
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,279
So depending on what quality you want,

89
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:31,560
how many more particles you're going to add,

90
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:38,270
all those different layers
become my particle system.

91
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:42,449
When we have this explosion here,

92
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:44,319
we have the glow.

93
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,530
And this is actually one particle.

94
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,759
I don't use objects for that.

95
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:52,299
And one simple particle.

96
00:06:52,299 --> 00:06:57,650
And we have the shockwave.
Again, it's one simple particle.

97
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:03,319
But, you're going to see my workflow. I just
take the same particle and I duplicate it.

98
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:07,650
I do not create new particle systems.

99
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:12,800
Explosion. The fire.

100
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,539
We have also the inner fire.

101
00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:19,219
I have the the debris.

102
00:07:19,219 --> 00:07:22,104
And again, each particle
was duplicated.

103
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:27,049
I never created a new particle
system. It was just a few changes.

104
00:07:27,049 --> 00:07:33,809
Because it's all connected to the same
forces, the same energy that works in it.

105
00:07:33,809 --> 00:07:36,929
The sparks too. The little
sparks will come up.

106
00:07:36,929 --> 00:07:43,370
I just changed the material
and the force in it.

107
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:49,729
So let me talk about the
movement of particles.

108
00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:53,770
We have here smoke and the fire.

109
00:07:53,770 --> 00:08:00,500
Both particles move along a
path or in a certain direction.

110
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:10,509
If you recreate in Unity a default particle
system, a Shuriken, you have a shape.

111
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:15,120
Raise your hand if
you use that shape.

112
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,860
Almost everybody.

113
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,889
I would say "never use it."

114
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:26,969
The reason is here.

115
00:08:26,969 --> 00:08:32,430
The particles are moving because of
forces and the velocity in the particle.

116
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:39,730
In reality, that shape does not give
me enough control for a movement.

117
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:42,680
I cannot animate a shape.

118
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,560
So we're gonna talk about the velocity
over time and force over time.

119
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:53,550
So that shape? Never
use it. Turn it off.

120
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:57,130
The particles still have
speed. They're coming out.

121
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:02,780
Who of you uses speed?
Raise your hands.

122
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,420
Again, don't use that.

123
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,480
Because in Unity,
the speed is five.

124
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,320
But in reality, question
yourself "why?"

125
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,830
"What is speed?"

126
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:17,190
A car drives forward.

127
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,410
That is speed.

128
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:23,970
But smoke? The car goes forward,
but smoke has no speed.

129
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:27,560
Fire has no speed, because
forces work on it.

130
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,710
I have never seen a particle
with an engine in it.

131
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:34,140
Never seen it.

132
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,920
But, tell me if you see one.

133
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,030
When I look at the smoke here,

134
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:46,190
I wonder if it's speed,
force, or velocity.

135
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,370
I could move up because of heat,

136
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:52,130
and heat changes over
time. It cools down.

137
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:55,030
So speed does not work for me.

138
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:59,660
It goes to the left because
of a force of wind.

139
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:04,340
So I never use speed, but
pure force and velocity.

140
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:09,390
So again, this speed doesn't give me
enough control, and it's not realistic.

141
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:16,030
So I turn off speed, and now I have
one particle that stands in the middle.

142
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:19,860
So we're going to use
again velocity and force.

143
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:26,620
But understanding force and velocity is the
essence of creating a great particle system.

144
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:32,170
And sadly, our manual does not
go in depth to explain the power.

145
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:37,630
So I have here a particle system,
and I put a force on it of two.

146
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:45,110
My particles, over time, will go more and
more into the X-axis because it's added to it.

147
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:47,730
It becomes more and more stronger.

148
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,400
It sounds great.

149
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,320
So we get that curve.

150
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,830
What is velocity?

151
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,330
If I add a velocity to it of two,

152
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:59,830
all my particle system turns.

153
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,950
But, it does not add.

154
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:05,720
It does not get
stronger and stronger

155
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,840
There's a huge difference there.

156
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,140
The one is linear,

157
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:14,420
and the one is at that curve.

158
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,220
So here's the power of velocity.

159
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,820
I key frame it.

160
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:25,490
If I put it to four, and then to
minus four, I go to left and right.

161
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:28,740
But when I put it to
zero, I go back up.

162
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:34,500
So I am fully in control of
the motion of the particle.

163
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,760
When I use force, it
becomes difficult.

164
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,130
Look now.

165
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:43,990
The value is zero, but still my
particle goes to the right.

166
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:51,360
Because I added--four minus four is not
actually zero with this. It becomes two--

167
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,840
it comes to minus two.

168
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:59,540
So it becomes very difficult to make the
mat to get a control system over this.

169
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:04,560
So I never used force for the
direction of my particles.

170
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,040
When do I use force?

171
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,790
If I want to add
force for gravity,

172
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:15,520
like for explosions, if I want
to add it to my velocity.

173
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:20,970
So for the look of the particles, the easiest
way I found, is to create materials.

174
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:27,280
There's a lot of different textures out there that
I can use to create the random feelings to it.

175
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:36,410
I also use a lot of animated textures. I like
to have, over time, the materials change.

176
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:39,050
But I use it also like for debris.

177
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:47,400
Instead of animating rocks that tumble, I use
particles and an animated texture sheet.

178
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:54,110
Now there's a very
complex, very intriguing

179
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:57,970
connection between the flow
of the particles and the look.

180
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:05,260
If I look here at my fire to the left,
and the smoke, both have the same flow.

181
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:09,210
So I duplicate my fire
and I change the color.

182
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:10,890
So it's smoke.

183
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:19,820
The only thing I have to do is actually change when
my particles become visible and how long they live.

184
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,310
That's how we make very fast particles.

185
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:26,320
You duplicate it, and then you
just change the factors in it.

186
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:37,010
Because you are using the real physics,
the real gravity and forces, from real life.

187
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:44,720
So let me talk about
Shuriken and mobile here.

188
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,910
One of the issues is of course the
overdraw, when you use it on particles.

189
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:54,120
Unity 4 has a lot of
improvements on performance.

190
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,770
But ask yourself the first question,
the first most important question.

191
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:03,700
"Do you need a particle system?"

192
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,140
A nice example is Shadowgun.

193
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:12,350
On the left, you see those crazy machines
with the green things that are moving.

194
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:17,540
Your first reaction is, "wow,
did they do those particles?"

195
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,390
Well, no, they didn't do particles.

196
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,680
It's animated textures.

197
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,720
It's much better on performance.

198
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,870
So it's the same with rain.

199
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:33,900
Why do you use rain in a game? It's because
you want to create a dramatic feeling to it.

200
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:40,130
But will thousands of
particles create that?

201
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:43,339
But maybe I can go another
way to create a feeling?

202
00:14:43,339 --> 00:14:51,380
Just by bringing down the lights, maybe
lightning, instead of rain to get that feeling.

203
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:58,820
So the more particles and also the more particle
systems you use, you're going to have more overdraw.

204
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:04,650
If you have a short particle system,
where you have an instance to overdraw,

205
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:08,830
I highly advise that you download a
Sprite Packer on the Asset Store.

206
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:13,190
It's a free package that was actually
created by one of our employees

207
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:19,210
who on a regular basis comes
to the office, sometimes not.

208
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:23,440
The cool thing is it converts
it to a sequence of sprites

209
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,410
instead of having problems
with the overdraw, then.

210
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:32,420
It's for free and nicely
converts it for you.

211
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:40,300
The cool thing is also if you dig up your old
particle systems with the legacy particle system,

212
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,540
it can convert automatically to a Shuriken

213
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:51,390
and then create a sequence of
sprite animations out of it.

214
00:15:52,900 --> 00:16:00,520
You also have to question yourself "should I use
animated meshes?" versus animated mesh particles.

215
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:04,700
Especially when you
create effects like this.

216
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:10,550
The one on the left was
animated by using 3D meshes.

217
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:14,770
Trail rendering.

218
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:23,220
I have more draw calls, of course, on it--
on that one--but a lot less overdraw.

219
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,270
But when I did it in particles,

220
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:31,800
so my particles were actually
not moving, no speed.

221
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:37,170
The only thing I did is animated the
direction and animated the material over it.

222
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:40,750
And, a little bit of trail render.

223
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,340
I had, of course, a lot less draw calls.

224
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:46,750
But my overdraw was
high. Look at that balance.

225
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:53,980
What is most effective and
most performance for mobile specific.

226
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:58,580
Another thing you can
do is create a script

227
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:05,583
that controls the emitter rate; how many
particles are emitted based on distance.

228
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:10,350
If you go further away, don't use all
your particles. Just reduce them.

229
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:17,470
And also look at the transparency. Maybe I can
swap it with a texture that's not transparent.

230
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:24,470
Another very interesting one is the
parameter of Max Screen Scale.

231
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:29,380
This parameter helps you like when
you're gonna walk through clouds,

232
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:38,270
and it can basically define how big the particles have to
be before it gets rendered, or it can remove it, basically.

233
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:43,084
Since Unity 4, we have
also World Collision.

234
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:47,649
So that means that all particles can
collide with anything in the scene,

235
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:51,340
even animated objects.

236
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:59,329
Really great, but if you're going to put that
in mobile, you might have a little problem.

237
00:17:59,429 --> 00:18:01,840
The first thing I want to point out is that

238
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:07,150
in the quality settings, you
have high, medium, and low.

239
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:16,230
High means that you're actually gonna cache all your
particles for the collision, but at every frame.

240
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,607
And then you have low, medium.

241
00:18:18,633 --> 00:18:27,770
And then medium and low means basically you're gonna
cache a certain amount of your particles for the collision.

242
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:36,751
And then the cool thing is actually that you can define how
much your Particle Raycast Budget is based on your platform.

243
00:18:36,777 --> 00:18:40,550
And this is a screenshot
from in the quality menu.

244
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:50,710
And from there, you can say for my iPhone,
you're gonna use 64, and for my PC, 8500.

245
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:53,676
Because of that, you
can have nice control.

246
00:18:53,702 --> 00:18:58,870
But if you use like an explosion, you don't
really need a perfect collision, always.

247
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:06,780
Just from major ones, yes, and that's why
you put your raycast budget much lower.

248
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:11,200
Another issue that a lot of
people have is scaling Shuriken.

249
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:17,440
When I select the root of
Shuriken, I cannot scale it.

250
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,440
So that's really sad, because you can make a beautiful fire,

251
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:27,460
and then you create a new project, a new game,
and you have a much bigger scale in the game.

252
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:30,750
It doesn't it work. You cannot scale it.

253
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:40,429
The cool thing is, in the asset store you
can find Cartoon Effects Easy Editor.

254
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:45,250
This is a nice extension that it can add
and you can scale your particles in that.

255
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:52,480
Just click any scale, even when there's different
particle systems underneath the structure.

256
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,920
And the cool thing is I like to use
my scaling of my particles because

257
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:02,870
like I'm running around with a shotgun, I have a
little particle system, and when I see far away,

258
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,529
another particle is bigger.

259
00:20:04,529 --> 00:20:09,120
Thanks to that, I only
need to create one.

260
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:16,020
And then with pooling, you have one in the scene and
then you move them around with different sizes.

261
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:19,020
Let's go a little bit hands-on here, now.

262
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:26,140
So I'm gonna' quickly go over those
different particle systems, here.

263
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:30,860
So what we have here is the

264
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:35,710
in this case we have the fire.

265
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:42,610
We have here the...

266
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:45,710
first, the fire here.

267
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,050
RGB.

268
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:50,450
So this is my fire and
I have my smoke here.

269
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:55,100
So you can see already that my
fire and smoke are actually the same.

270
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:59,580
But my smoke lives longer
and starts a bit later.

271
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:06,770
And then we have sparks who live longer
and have a little bit more force to it.

272
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:12,210
But let's talk first about the inner
particle, here. Let's create that also.

273
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:22,770
So I create here a particle system
and I move it to the right here.

274
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:31,620
The particles come out. So as I said
before, I do not like to use speed

275
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:38,779
because I want full control over it,
and I do not like to use a shape.

276
00:21:38,779 --> 00:21:43,170
So I'm going to create some
force for it, velocity for it.

277
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:48,270
And here, the Y, I'm
gonna put it to "world,"

278
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:51,340
and the Y, I'm going to bring it up.

279
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,870
The particles go up.

280
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:59,309
I'm gonna say "okay, that's
good." Maybe one up.

281
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:07,420
And I can't in the X-axis, or--In
the Z-axis, you'll see it better.

282
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,990
See, we cannot define?

283
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:12,409
But I want them to go left and right.

284
00:22:12,409 --> 00:22:14,789
So that's why I'm gonna say here click

285
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:18,680
"random" between two curves.

286
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:25,340
So we have here the Z-axis,
and I'm going to do between

287
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:29,840
one and minus one.

288
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,830
And I don't want them to go too much
out so I can animate it over time.

289
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:40,299
And you have the life of the particle.

290
00:22:40,299 --> 00:22:43,210
So now they go both directions, here.

291
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,200
I can do the same for my X-axis.

292
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,320
But in my Y, here.

293
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:53,630
So I give them a velocity of going up, here.

294
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:58,090
But in the beginning, I want them to go
faster and then slow, and that's how we nicely

295
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:02,880
can adjust this function curve here. Maybe
I'm gonna put it to four or five going up,

296
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,690
and then here, bringing it down.

297
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:13,640
So over time, what we see is the particles
go up fast here, but they slow down.

298
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:20,640
Just going to do it for this one too, here.

299
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:27,250
And we make it a little random, here.

300
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:30,840
So you see now, I start to have
nice control over the shape.

301
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,750
Especially here in the Z-axis, now.

302
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:37,960
I can define the Z-axis.

303
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:44,080
See, I can define how my
shape will be for my particles.

304
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:49,909
Otherwise, if I use a regular shape, I
have no control over exactly what I want.

305
00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:51,950
So particles come out.

306
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:55,570
Now, let's make them a little bit shorter.

307
00:23:55,570 --> 00:24:03,110
So one, and the start
life, maybe 0.8.

308
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:08,500
But some particles will live a bit longer,
so random in between two values.

309
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:13,580
Maybe 1.5.

310
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,130
Let's add a bit more particles to it.

311
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:20,590
Like 50 particles.

312
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:24,810
So we see nicely the effect on
it. It goes left and right a bit.

313
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:31,169
Now what I want also is that the
sizes are a little bit different.

314
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:40,179
So maybe like 0.6 up to
maximum, 1.3 or something.

315
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:42,880
So we have different sizes in there.

316
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,904
So now I start to be happy with
the movement of my particles.

317
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:49,910
I'm gonna add here now
color to it, like smoke.

318
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:58,290
So we can use a texture like this.

319
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:01,980
I'm gonna add it to
my particle system.

320
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,179
So we have this.

321
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:05,330
Okay, let's add some color to it.

322
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:08,330
Color over lifetime.

323
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:14,300
And then click here.

324
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:18,539
All my particles start--like fire,
in general, starts to be yellow.

325
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:24,840
And also, we can put
here some yellow color.

326
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:29,159
And it will become red.

327
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:33,390
And I have to use this one.

328
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:37,720
So first, I start yellow.

329
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,160
Over time, they become red.

330
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:46,240
And over time, they become dark.

331
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,799


332
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,240
In the beginning,

333
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,990
they will be more transparent
because they are starting to create,

334
00:25:54,990 --> 00:26:00,170
and overtime, they're gonna
fade out, my particles.

335
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:01,680
That's how I start to create it.

336
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,029
I want a little bit more change, like
the flames are turning and twisting.

337
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:12,250
So what I can do is really, simply the starting
of the particles have different rotations.

338
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:15,730
So between like zero and 360.

339
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:21,899
Let me show you that in the wireframe mode. So, you
start to see that the particles have different rotations.

340
00:26:21,899 --> 00:26:25,580
But over time, I can also moved them.

341
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:33,250
So, rotation over
lifetime, random again.

342
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:40,250
And now we see it start to twist
and rotate the particle itself.

343
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:43,590
And that's how we start
to create our fire, initially.

344
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:49,169
Then the really simple thing is
that we're gonna call this fire.

345
00:26:49,169 --> 00:26:54,240
What I do now is that I duplicate
it, and I have a "fire," here.

346
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,150
And I'm gonna call it "smoke."

347
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:02,150
I'm gonna make it a child of my inner fire.

348
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:12,500
Make sure I select
the right smoke.

349
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,080
That's my smoke. Okay.

350
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,750
And fire, okay. Smoke...

351
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:27,470
Okay, cool. The moment you make it a child,
they're both running in simulation, here.

352
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:29,150
So that's pretty cool.

353
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:33,700
So the only thing I have to do is that my
smoke will live longer. It's really simple.

354
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,480
So the lifetime?

355
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,450
It's the life time, here.

356
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:45,370
I'm going to make it from
0.6 to 1.9 or something.

357
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:48,200
So they live longer, here.

358
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,590
And then we can go
to the colors, here.

359
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:56,590
So our--they will be more darker
than here from the beginning.

360
00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:02,060
But, you can put here also
darker than the beginning.

361
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:10,740
But I don't need them really in the beginning here.
What I do is just move the transparency to here.

362
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,030
Make it more transparent.

363
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:16,830
See, and nicely we don't have any beginning.

364
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:19,299
And then more in the end.

365
00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:23,550
In the end, make sure they're
fully transparent, here.

366
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:33,419
If you look good, sometimes you're going to see artifacts.
Some particles don't know which one to render first.

367
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:38,400
And how you can fix that, my
fire should be rendering first.

368
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,639
And we can do that in
the Sorting Fudge.

369
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:47,610
So I just bring the
Sorting Fudge up,

370
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:53,150
and that gives those particles a priority.
So they're gonna render first.

371
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:57,430
And also I'm gonna say that they should--

372
00:28:57,430 --> 00:29:01,410
that all those particles
should render first.

373
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:05,590
And then I can add a
bit more particles to it.

374
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:11,010
And then, really simple. Look, my
smoke. Y'know, duplicate that.

375
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:16,950
And I'm gonna change the
material to little dots.

376
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:21,700
So I have here a flash-something.

377
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:26,599
So we have now dots. We're just
going to make them smaller now.

378
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:32,200
Okay, 0.66 or something.

379
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,630
And 0.2.

380
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:37,500
Okay, so we have those little dots.

381
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,860
Make it a bit more
visible, for the fun.

382
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:43,319
And then the color. Just the
color, we have to change again.

383
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:48,080
Click. This color.

384
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,559
We're gonna make it yellow.

385
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:54,670
And then we can make different colors.
And so we have those dots.

386
00:29:54,670 --> 00:30:00,570
And then I'm gonna just make them
a little bit--live longer again.

387
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:07,066
But when you look very good at fire, those little
dots fly more around because of the forces on it.

388
00:30:07,092 --> 00:30:10,870
They're so light
and there's wind.

389
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:15,610
So now, how are we gonna use force?
So we're gonna add forces, here.

390
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:24,789
If I put X up--let's see world again--the Y here,
up and down, I'm gonna bring it a little bit up.

391
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:26,679
And Z to the left.

392
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:29,429
But I want it also to the other
side. That's right, actually.

393
00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:32,890
What I'm going to do is just
random between two values.

394
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:37,779
So like four and minus four.

395
00:30:37,779 --> 00:30:39,810
So now we see them going left.

396
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:42,240
And minus four.

397
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,890
So you see the particles are
going left and right now.

398
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:52,286
But what actually wants is that sometimes they go left
and then they randomly exchange different values.

399
00:30:52,312 --> 00:30:54,810
We can do that with
randomize. See?

400
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:58,360
And now I have those
particles going left and right.

401
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,510
So this is a technique
I mainly use.

402
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:09,360
Just duplicate the particles and change
what has to change from a natural flow.

403
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,639
This needs to be then to the storm here.

404
00:31:13,139 --> 00:31:17,490
When we look at this dust
devil here, this particle,

405
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:22,670
the motion is fully
controlled by the velocity.

406
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:25,890
See the X goes more
and more and more?

407
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:28,909
That's what we create that pattern of left and right.

408
00:31:28,909 --> 00:31:33,720
If you want to turn a little bit afterwards,
you can now use the force.

409
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:39,419
And here, like a random
or a constant value.

410
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:42,419
See, now you can.

411
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:51,610
Make sure you have that one correct.
Now you can move your particle system.

412
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:57,880
Let's look quickly
at this one here.

413
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:02,700
We have here our fire one.

414
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:11,909
So we see those particles and we understand that now.
But how do we control something like a glow like this?

415
00:32:11,909 --> 00:32:13,770
It's really simple, actually.

416
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:16,480
You create another particle.
It's a particle system.

417
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:22,340
No speed again, and no shape.

418
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,570
The emission, I don't need ten particles.

419
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:28,460
This is a bit complex here in Unity.

420
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:35,750
We have the maximum particles, the rate, so that we can
never more than a thousand particles basically, over time.

421
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:36,810
And ten here.

422
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:41,440
So you're gonna do
plus zero. Zero particles.

423
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,920
But at frame one, I'm gonna generate
30 particle. I'm gonna say one.

424
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:52,870
So we're just gonna create one particle system,
and I'm gonna make it a duration of one second,

425
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:56,560
and not loop the moment. So press play.

426
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:02,800
Where is my particle system, here?

427
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:09,200
Gonna loop it.

428
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,529
So we have that one particle here.

429
00:33:12,529 --> 00:33:15,550
But I don't need that fireball here now.

430
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:20,029
So we see that one
particle here created.

431
00:33:20,029 --> 00:33:22,159
And we're not going to loop it.

432
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:26,340
So what we're gonna--not loop.

433
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,740
So we have that one particle it creates.

434
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,299
And now, you just animate the transparency

435
00:33:31,299 --> 00:33:36,289
and the color of the lifetime.

436
00:33:36,289 --> 00:33:44,220
I think we're gonna put
it here to yellow.

437
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:47,010
So I'm gonna press play here.

438
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:50,010
And we can now do transparencies.
So now you see we have a particle.

439
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:54,200
That's how I can do my intensity and I
can add a bit burst and a bit rate.

440
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,389
And then I'm going to get
that feeling of a particle.

441
00:33:57,389 --> 00:33:59,460
We can duplicate it.

442
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:03,840
We can look here now at an explosion.

443
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:11,449
Then I go to my explosion here.

444
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:18,229
So, we saw the...

445
00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:24,629
Okay, wait a second here.

446
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:37,849
Okay, my explosion we're
gonna remove this. Sorry.

447
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:41,279
So we have a glow
here that we saw

448
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:43,429
and that's that one particle.

449
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:46,000
Then we create and then
we animate the transparency.

450
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,959
The shockwave is exactly
the same structure.

451
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:57,129
So, stop this.

452
00:34:57,129 --> 00:35:04,129
Remove the sparks for the moment.

453
00:35:04,279 --> 00:35:06,200
So I duplicate the one particle

454
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,239
and the only thing I have to do

455
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:10,479
I put another material on it.

456
00:35:10,479 --> 00:35:15,420
You animate the scale a little bit over time.
That's how we get the shock wave now.

457
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:19,959
And then the sparks.

458
00:35:19,959 --> 00:35:21,669
This again.

459
00:35:21,669 --> 00:35:25,109
A burst of 15 particles,
I'm going to create.

460
00:35:25,109 --> 00:35:32,109
Like in-game object, gonna
create a particle system.

461
00:35:32,389 --> 00:35:39,329
And I'm going to put the--let's
see... To one, here.

462
00:35:39,329 --> 00:35:46,879
We're gonna put the speed
again to zero, and no shape.

463
00:35:46,879 --> 00:35:49,429
And I want to create the sparkles flying out.

464
00:35:49,429 --> 00:35:55,999
So the best way to do that is to actually
create a velocity over lifetime again.

465
00:35:55,999 --> 00:36:01,049
And we can do again random curves.

466
00:36:01,049 --> 00:36:06,089
So I want to do it in X and Z, both.

467
00:36:09,589 --> 00:36:11,829
See, we bring them out.

468
00:36:11,829 --> 00:36:19,689
Then, in Z, we're going to do exactly the
same so that they go in all the directions.

469
00:36:19,889 --> 00:36:22,099
And that's an explosion.
It goes in every direction.

470
00:36:22,099 --> 00:36:27,740
And there, we use the velocity because
the energy comes out and it slows down.

471
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:31,909
Again with the Z,
with the Y too.

472
00:36:33,909 --> 00:36:36,399
So you know my particles
go in every direction.

473
00:36:36,399 --> 00:36:42,789
Most people would use an emitter sphere, but the
problem is that you don't have control over a sphere.

474
00:36:42,789 --> 00:36:48,699
So particles come out, you can
add a bit of gravity to it.

475
00:36:48,699 --> 00:36:53,969
No, do a little bit, so the
particles come out.

476
00:36:53,969 --> 00:36:57,269
The size, I'm going to
make a little bit smaller.

477
00:36:57,269 --> 00:37:00,429
And now we can use our
force on the particles.

478
00:37:00,429 --> 00:37:06,479
And again, random between
two curves in our values.

479
00:37:06,479 --> 00:37:10,579
Again, make four and minus four.

480
00:37:10,879 --> 00:37:13,699
Four and minus four.

481
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:18,109
And four and minus four.

482
00:37:18,109 --> 00:37:21,379
And that's what we start to
get that particles going out.

483
00:37:21,379 --> 00:37:29,079
I could have done a bit more gravity to it,
but the cool thing is in the render here.

484
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:31,719
Click here, we're gonna stretch the billboards

485
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:36,119
and scaling

486
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:38,969
and based on that now,

487
00:37:38,969 --> 00:37:42,949
you can create the
feeling that they fly out.

488
00:37:42,949 --> 00:37:46,209
And that's how we start with that.

489
00:37:46,209 --> 00:37:52,359
Then you can duplicate that and
things and materials in that case.

490
00:37:53,609 --> 00:38:01,189
Using those bursts, that's how
I created that heart, here.

491
00:38:02,809 --> 00:38:09,309
It's really simple. You have
one particle system.

492
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:16,419
That is one particle and it goes
up. You give it a bit of force up.

493
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:21,919
And then you create the
slice particle here.

494
00:38:21,919 --> 00:38:27,589
And then the only thing we
have to do is to start a delay.

495
00:38:27,589 --> 00:38:33,969
And then we have a left particle system,
like for the left heart, with one object,

496
00:38:33,969 --> 00:38:37,959
and also start a delay and put
the gravity to--put forces on it.

497
00:38:37,959 --> 00:38:42,319
And then the right side is a duplicate
of the left side, and you flip it.

498
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:50,269
And now that's how you get your particle system by
just duplicating one single instance of particles.

499
00:38:52,969 --> 00:38:59,969
It is the same for the ground impact, here.

500
00:39:04,029 --> 00:39:06,129
Press play.

501
00:39:06,129 --> 00:39:07,369
Okay, I'm gonna show it to you.

502
00:39:07,369 --> 00:39:11,461
So the floor is one
particle system.

503
00:39:14,287 --> 00:39:16,964
And then the rest makes
sense now for you guys.

504
00:39:17,139 --> 00:39:25,529
So the ground impact here, we use a horizontal
billboard so that it's flat on the ground

505
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,640
instead of straight facing the camera.

506
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,679
And that's the only thing you have to do.

507
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:36,805
And when we look at the force
field here, this is a 3D object.

508
00:39:38,031 --> 00:39:41,389
You're actually using one
particle for the fading,

509
00:39:41,389 --> 00:39:47,859
and the other particles are just objects
you move around with a trail renderer.

510
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:55,449
And then this one, I did
is actually the same.

511
00:39:55,449 --> 00:40:00,119
I took objects, put a trail renderer
on it, and move them around.

512
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:03,639
But the last thing I
wanna bring up here,

513
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:05,889
I'm gonna go to this one.

514
00:40:05,889 --> 00:40:11,739
Let's talk about World Collision.

515
00:40:11,739 --> 00:40:16,207
And I should have
here somewhere rain.

516
00:40:16,533 --> 00:40:17,774
No?

517
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:24,309
Then I should go to scenes here,

518
00:40:24,309 --> 00:40:26,849
and test.

519
00:40:30,849 --> 00:40:34,919
I saved it just before I can hit World Collision.

520
00:40:34,919 --> 00:40:42,659
So what we have here is
we have our rain here.

521
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:46,009
So our particles of our rain come out here

522
00:40:46,009 --> 00:40:47,369
and when they hit the floor,

523
00:40:47,369 --> 00:40:51,109
another particle is created by collision.

524
00:40:51,109 --> 00:40:54,249
Something we had before.

525
00:40:54,249 --> 00:41:01,419
But what the new thing is that when you do your
collision to world, it collides with all the objects.

526
00:41:01,419 --> 00:41:07,219
You can define by layers how
many objects will collide.

527
00:41:07,219 --> 00:41:15,199
But the most important thing
is that here, in the collision,

528
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:20,149
here, it's changed from
a simple plane to a world.

529
00:41:20,149 --> 00:41:21,600
And here is the quality.

530
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,519
Medium, high, low.

531
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:31,999
But the most important thing is, for mobile,
is that you go to your quality settings.

532
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:39,499
And in the quality settings, you can, per
platform, define your Particle Raycast Budget.

533
00:41:39,499 --> 00:41:41,929
And then the cool thing is that
you get cool effects like this.

534
00:41:41,929 --> 00:41:47,479
This you can download from our blog.

535
00:41:47,479 --> 00:41:53,290
So this was a a quick overview on how you
structure you particles, and you duplicate them.

536
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:56,699
Don't use speed,
don't use shape.

537
00:41:56,699 --> 00:41:59,600
You control it, so you can
create what you want.

538
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:05,089
And the less parameters you need to use--
if you mix it with speed, it becomes complex.

539
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:12,749
And check out the Asset Store, so you can
convert your particles to a sequence of sprites.

540
00:42:12,749 --> 00:42:16,939
For mobile, it helps a lot, and
use your quality settings.

541
00:42:16,939 --> 00:42:19,599
And use some of the techniques.

542
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:22,019
So thank you for paying attention.

543
00:42:22,019 --> 00:42:28,649
I have 3 minutes left on the stage before they
put in a box and ship me back to the snow.

544
00:42:28,649 --> 00:42:32,649
So, what are your questions?

545
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:47,429


546
00:42:47,429 --> 00:42:52,909


547
00:42:52,909 --> 00:42:53,960
Wait a second.

548
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:57,189


549
00:42:57,189 --> 00:42:59,049


550
00:42:59,049 --> 00:43:02,070


551
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:07,800


552
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:14,800


553
00:43:23,409 --> 00:43:27,039
What he can do is basically here.

554
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:30,459
You've seen...

555
00:43:30,459 --> 00:43:31,579
You can...

556
00:43:31,579 --> 00:43:34,209
A particle system.

557
00:43:34,209 --> 00:43:37,699
So this particle here,

558
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:41,989
they die here, and you want from
there to create a new particle.

559
00:43:41,989 --> 00:43:44,669
So, what I would do is

560
00:43:44,669 --> 00:43:46,279
I will go to

561
00:43:47,699 --> 00:43:50,179
subemitters.

562
00:43:50,179 --> 00:43:52,969
And when my particle is dead,

563
00:43:52,969 --> 00:43:57,470
I'm gonna create a
new particle system.

564
00:43:57,470 --> 00:44:01,509
But this particle system,
that's a mirror.

565
00:44:02,509 --> 00:44:05,549
Remove. Go to the emission.

566
00:44:05,549 --> 00:44:08,429
And the burst to one.

567
00:44:08,429 --> 00:44:11,259
So when that particle is dead,

568
00:44:11,259 --> 00:44:12,869
you create a new particle.

569
00:44:12,869 --> 00:44:16,229
Now if you want to continue that,

570
00:44:16,229 --> 00:44:19,119
so you say "look," you're
gonna change the color here.

571
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:22,979
What I would do is inherit the velocity,

572
00:44:22,979 --> 00:44:27,479
bring this up,

573
00:44:27,479 --> 00:44:29,299
I'm gonna put it to one,

574
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:36,299
I'm gonna make the size of bit bigger.

575
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:38,240
Start the size here--okay, here.

576
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:41,399
No, it's a bit too big.

577
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:49,359
So now, when that particle dies,
a new particle system comes up.

578
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:52,239
So it's really around, instead of
activating and deactivating.

579
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:56,059
Another way you could do it
is animate the transparency.

580
00:44:56,059 --> 00:45:01,259
Lifts, certain time, becomes
transparent and comes back.

581
00:45:01,259 --> 00:45:08,259
(Yeah, thank you very much.)
Thank you.

582
00:45:08,769 --> 00:45:15,769
One more question?

583
00:45:18,669 --> 00:45:20,549


584
00:45:20,549 --> 00:45:25,639


585
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:32,639


586
00:45:33,649 --> 00:45:35,730
You can definitely do
it from a surface,

587
00:45:35,756 --> 00:45:40,979
so if you go in the emission
here--no, shape.

588
00:45:40,979 --> 00:45:42,989
Emit from...

589
00:45:42,989 --> 00:45:44,499
Okay, you have here...

590
00:45:44,499 --> 00:45:51,689
Here you can say it emits from a sphere.
Gimme a sphere, a box, or a mesh you define.

591
00:45:51,689 --> 00:45:52,739
Okay?

592
00:45:52,739 --> 00:45:56,319
And it will pick it from the vertexes.

593
00:45:56,319 --> 00:46:04,789
Now I'm not 100 percent sure, but if your mesh is
animated, then it will still come out the vertex.

594
00:46:04,789 --> 00:46:10,179
But I've never tested bringing
it out from an animated mesh.

595
00:46:13,549 --> 00:46:15,459
Open project...

596
00:46:18,969 --> 00:46:24,989
so it should be and should be and uh...

597
00:46:24,989 --> 00:46:28,229
So it should be in...

598
00:46:33,629 --> 00:46:38,389
It should be a mesh that is actually
animated like with an enveloping,

599
00:46:38,389 --> 00:46:43,599
or "skinning" they call it, but I don't have an
example here ready to just test it out.

600
00:46:45,809 --> 00:46:49,309
I definitely got to test that out.

601
00:46:49,309 --> 00:46:55,729
So, okay, I will be in touch. I'm gonna test
it here right away after the presentation.

602
00:46:55,729 --> 00:47:00,499

time over and come to listen to me.
