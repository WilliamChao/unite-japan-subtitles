00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:47,438
皆様、ようこそこんにちは。
Welcome, everyone.

2
00:03:47,439 --> 00:04:00,039
本日は「バタフライエフェクト」というムービーについてのプレゼンを通じて DirectX 11 グラフィックス機能を紹介します。
I will be doing a presentation on a movie called "Butterfly Effect,"
that will show off some DirectX 11 graphic features.

3
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:03,868
それでは自己紹介から。
A bit about me, first.

4
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:05,839
私の名前はアーランドで、
My name is Erland

5
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,298
ユニティ テクノロジーズのスウェーデン オフィス所属です。
and I'm from Unity Technologies' office in Sweden.

6
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:20,808
主にそこでデモに関連した研究関連の商品を扱ってます。
What we mainly do there is demo-related
and research-related products.

7
00:04:20,809 --> 00:04:25,939
言い換えると Unity を様々なエリアでテストを行なって
That means basically that we test Unity in various areas

8
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:32,739
改善できるところを探してます。
and see where we can find possibilites for improvement.

9
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,718
私はAAA出身です。
I come from a AAA background.

10
00:04:35,719 --> 00:04:39,839
Unityに入る前はEAで働いていて
Previously to Unity, I worked at Electronic Arts

11
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:48,270
DICEを仕事場にして、バトルフィールドおよびミラーズ エッジのフランチャイズに関わってました。
specifically at DICE, where I worked on the
Battlefield franchise and Mirror's Edge.

12
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:54,159
それでは、短い映像を紹介します。
So, I will bring you through the short film.

13
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,409
早速見てみましょうか。
We will watch that.

14
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:02,388
後で見たい方にはYoutube動画も利用できます。
It's also available on YouTube if you want to see it again.

15
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:10,688
次に様々なグラフィックス機能およびその未来の可能性について
Then I will walk you through the various
graphic features and possibilities

16
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:17,488
DX11 を通して実現できたことを紹介して、
that made us able to do this through DX11,

17
00:05:17,489 --> 00:05:22,508
さらにUnityの中でのグラフィックス実現についてデモをします。
and demonstrate the graphic capabilities directly in Unity.

18
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:27,009
では出来るだけリアルタイム デモをして
So I will do more like a real-time demonstration of this

19
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:37,098
この動画作成に特化して開発されたUnity ベータ版を使用します。
using the beta version of Unity that we developed
specifically for the purpose of this movie.

20
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:45,599
ではムービーを再生しましょうか。
So, let's watch the movie.

21
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:38,659
これで終わりですね。
That's it.

22
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,630
どうですか、楽しんでもらえましたか？
I hope you enjoyed it.

23
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:52,829
ムービーで使われたグラフィックス機能をご紹介していきましょう。
So now I will bring you through the
graphic features that were in this movie.

24
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,629
まずは制作過程について。
The production, a bit about that.

25
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,989
リアルタイム再生のショートフィルムで2分半の映像は
It's a real time short film, about
two-and-a-half minutes long

26
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:02,039
全て Unity を使用して作成してます。
and it's fully using Unity.

27
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,510
先に申し上げたとおり研究プロジェクトから生まれました。
It was done, as I said earlier, as a research project.

28
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:17,809
これは Unity, Passion Pictures, NVIDIA の共同製作です。
This is a collaboration not only between
Unity, but Passion Pictures and nVidia.

29
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:26,279
Passion Pictures の CG アーティストはアートのほぼ全てを扱いました。
Passion Pictures were the CG artists that
did almost all the art for this.

30
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:33,749
ピーク時において、25 名 の CG アーティストと
It was, at its peak, about
twenty-five CG artists and roughly

31
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,249
およそ 5 名のフルタイムプログラマが協力しました。
five full-time programmers.

32
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:43,689
Unity, NVIDIA のプログラマです。
These programmers were from
both Unity and nVidia

33
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:49,759
Passion Pictures は純粋にアーティストのみでした。
but Passion Pictures only supported with artists.

34
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,569
製作期間は全体で 14 週間。
The total length of the production
was about fourteen weeks.

35
00:09:53,570 --> 00:10:00,119
最適化および調整にさらに時間をかけたのは
We added some additional time on that be able
to polish and basically optimize it

36
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:07,989
アーティストがリアルタイム映像が未経験のためです。
because these artists had no prior
experience with any real time film.

37
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:12,509
プロジェクト全体で 40 GB のデータがあり
In total, the whole project is about 40GB of data

38
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:19,509
容量の大部分はアニメーションのポイント キャッシュ データです。
and mainly the biggest chunk of that goes
into point cache data for the animations.

39
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:26,339
見て分かるとおり精巧な クロス (Cloth) 物理挙動が含まれてます。
As you could see, there were some
elaborate cloth physics happening there.

40
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:32,249
ここはあまりにクロス (Cloth) のレイヤーが多いため、事前シミュレーションが必要で
It's actually pre-simulated because
there were so many layers of clothes

41
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:38,039
さらに高速な動きがあったため選択肢はない状況でした。
and they were moving so rapidly
that we didn't have any alternative.

42
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:46,270
このときアーティストは事前シミュレーションしたクロスを完全に制御できました。
It also enabled the artists to have full
control over the pre-simulated cloth.

43
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,198
容量のもうひとつの大きな部分はライトマップです。
Another large part of that is the light maps.

44
00:10:51,199 --> 00:10:57,550
ほぼ全てのシーン毎に別のライトマップが使われてます。
Almost each scene has a separate set of light maps.

45
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,849
その理由は、基本的に
This was because we wanted to be able to

46
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:12,359
ショット毎に別のライティングの向きや別の大域照明が必要だったことです。
have different lighting directions and different
setups of global illuminations per shot, basically.

47
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:21,719
プロジェクトではキャッシュサーバを最大限に活用したことも付け加えます。
Also, I should note that we were using the
cache server for this project quite heavily.

48
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:28,549
このプロジェクトの最大のゴールは DirectX 11 を実装して
During this project, one of our biggest
goals was to implement DirectX 11

49
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:39,989
Unity の 64 ビット エディタが大量のデータを実際にハンドリングすることでした。
and to have a 64-bit editor of Unity to actually be
able to handle all these large quantities of data.

50
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,579
それではこのプロジェクトのゴールについてもう少し。
So our goal for this project.

51
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:49,829
この CG スタジオのオフライン ツールを追求して学習し、再現したうえで
We wanted to explore and study and mimic
the offline tools from this CG studio

52
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:53,919
Unity 上でどのように動作するかみて、
and basically how they worked, in Unity

53
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,369
そこから学ぶことが目的でした。
and study that.

54
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:04,979
ハイエンドのデモとして Unity を最大限にストレステストして、
This was intended to be a very high-end demo
that stress-tested Unity to a great degree

55
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,579
ひとつは製作期間できるかぎり短くすること、
both by having a very short production time

56
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:13,290
もうひとつは大人数のアーティストが同時にプロジェクトで作業をすること、を意図してます。
and having a large amount of artists
working simultaneously on this project.

57
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:23,849
さらにアーティストにとって、馴染み深く直感的なワークフローにして
Also, we wanted to create a very familiar and intuitive workflow
for these artists that reminded them very much of

58
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:30,458
普段使い慣れている 3D Studio Max, Maya, XSI のネイティブ プログラム、
what they're used to in their native programs
such as 3D Studio Max, Maya, XSI,

59
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:36,999
あるいは何らか別のシミュレーションやエフェクトのプログラムに近い操作感を再現する期待もありました。
or any kind of simulation program or effects program.

60
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:47,359
当時、Passion Pictures はリアルタイム映像やゲームはまったくの未経験でした。
Passion Pictures had, at the time, no experience
whatsoever doing real-time film or games.

61
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,579
Unity を短期間で学んだのですが、学習速度は早いものでした。
So we had to quickly teach them Unity,
which they adapted to very fast,

62
00:12:53,580 --> 00:13:02,610
また、そこから改善できるワークフローのフィードバックも得られました。
and from that also have them feedback to
us what workflows we could improve on.

63
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:13,019
映像の主な目的は高品質なムービーを作成して
The main goal of the film was to
produce a very high-quality movie

64
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:16,869
オフライン レンダリングを再現することでした。
that would resemble what you could do in offline rendering.

65
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:21,289
ところどころでアーティストは比較を行なって、
At points, these artists could
actually compare their results

66
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:32,249
3D プログラムと Unity とで見比べて同じ結果が得られるか確認できました。
in a 3D program and in Unity and they
would get very similar outcomes.

67
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,699
これが映像ターゲットの例です。
So here is a visual target.

68
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:42,229
これはアート ディレクターおよび Passion Pictures のメイン ディレクターの共同により作成されてます。
This was done by the art director together
with the main director at Passion Pictures.

69
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:47,539
これは映像の最終的なあるべき姿としての最終ドラフトでした。
This was their final draft basically of
how the feel of the movie should be.

70
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:51,769
現実的な描写というより漫画チックで、エキセントリックです。
A bit more cartoony and eccentric, rather than realistic.

71
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:57,329
Passion Pictures has a long experience
doing a very niche kind of style

72
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:01,879
and a bit more imaginative.

73
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:09,109
So this this kind of landed right in their area of expertise.

74
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,400
Here's another one.

75
00:14:10,401 --> 00:14:19,049
This shot actually never made it into the film, but
it still is very typical for how we wanted it to look

76
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:31,269
with very vibrant colors and a more stylized sense.

77
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:42,349
So the concept itself, what Unity wanted to do with this,
was to have a style that actually targeted our end-users.

78
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:46,269
We didn't aim to have any space marines

79
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:53,289
or stereotypical characters in this film.

80
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:58,359
We wanted it to be colorful
and slightly surreal.

81
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:07,269
It was fun to push the limits of
what's real or not and very extreme.

82
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:11,489
Also we wanted this movie to not
just be a real-time movie but a movie

83
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:17,910
that actually was watchable for people who
had no understanding of real-time film.

84
00:15:18,011 --> 00:15:31,729
So there was not supposed to be any game resemblance,
or any connections with games whatsoever.

85
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,849
Talking a bit about DirectX 11

86
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:39,138
I'm not a programmer, so I can't go into the
specifics, but there have been talks already here

87
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:42,219
that have touched on DirectX 11.

88
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:45,179
Kuba Cupisz

89
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:54,249
made a talk yesterday where where he addressed
DirectX 11 specifically from a programmer's perspective,

90
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:58,729
but I can brush on it a little bit.

91
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:08,479
For those of you who don't know, this is a collection of
Windows multimedia APIs that are used mainly for games.

92
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:19,859
DirectX 11 opens a much broader visual scope
for graphics by using the GPU more heavily and

93
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:23,779
providing much more fidelity to the art.

94
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:31,078
It also offloads efforts from the programmers,

95
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:35,769
they find easier solutions to do
very complicated things,

96
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:45,739
and gives artists the ability to use procedural
techniques that are really computed fast

97
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:51,499
and are really practical, both in
terms of memory and rendering time.

98
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,480
So DirectX 11...

99
00:16:54,510 --> 00:17:04,079
Our test case was done before Unity 4,
but it was transferred into Unity 4.0.

100
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:08,409
Since then it's been available.

101
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:13,639
So, what did it exactly enable us to do?

102
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:21,938
We got physically-based, energy-conservative
shaders on skin and eyes.

103
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:25,599
This is related to materials.

104
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:32,959
We have hair rendering with tesselation
for very fine strands of hair

105
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,100
and on slippers as well.

106
00:17:35,879 --> 00:17:41,249
We were able to do full-screen
post-effects, massive amounts of those

107
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:48,369
that corresponded very well to what a CG studio
expects to do in post-production.

108
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:58,049
And we were able to add some volumetric effects,
like that explosion at the very end.

109
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:02,259
A bit about the physically-based shaders.

110
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:09,119
Fundamentally, that is a material that just follows
the laws of physics with very predictable results.

111
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:18,309
What to gain from that is not only a very realistic
material, but also but it's also a material where

112
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:23,369
the artist cannot really fail.

113
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:37,209
It requires less tweaking and less cheating
to achieve a very realistic material.

114
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:40,500
Also, it's energy conserving.

115
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:54,999
Basically, light energy is distributed between the diffuse
reflection and refraction so it's balanced.

116
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:03,619
This happens automatically and this can be
very tricky to do this manually in a material.

117
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:07,019
So you save a lot of time by using this

118
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,249
and it's much more intuitive.

119
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,889
This is a material that we got inspiration from.

120
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:16,959
Mental Ray.

121
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,979
This is a widely used one in the movie industry.

122
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:28,859
We studied it quite closely and tried to adapt it
into a real-time version that worked fine in Unity.

123
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:33,879
So the bottom line for this shader is: we
use it on almost everything in this movie

124
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:41,350
and it can be used for almost anything. Anything
that is a hard surface material is able to have this.

125
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:50,700
That puts exceptions on organic materials, of course,
and also such things as skin and eyes.

126
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:58,750
So I will demonstrate this in Unity.

127
00:19:58,775 --> 00:20:00,775
Let's see...

128
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,100
Let me open up the file...

129
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:15,760
As you can see, the project has a lot of files.

130
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:21,085
Here we are.

131
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:33,449
What you can see here at the
bottom is a sequencer that we

132
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:40,129
constructed for Passion Pictures to
be able to scrub through shots

133
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:45,765
and be able to work directly
in Unity with that

134
00:20:45,766 --> 00:20:53,099
as they were animating or setting
up various camera angles and such.

135
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,410
If I show the material...

136
00:20:57,435 --> 00:20:59,435
Let's see...

137
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,660
If I pick this one, for example...

138
00:21:06,485 --> 00:21:08,485
Sorry about that.

139
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,610
I can pick this one.

140
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:21,450
Let me hide some of the more irrelevant things for this.

141
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:47,210
Here we go, here's a simple example.

142
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,519
As you can see,

143
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:55,475
for those of you that are familiar with
material inspector, we made some changes.

144
00:21:55,476 --> 00:22:06,999
We made a custom material inspector for this to be able to
fit all the properties that were necessary for this material.

145
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,499
Apart from having just a simple diffuse,
you're able to adjust roughness.

146
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,109
I don't know if it's visible, but

147
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:23,579
that basically determines how rough
the surface of this material is.

148
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:32,009
We have reflection, so we could basically
adjust the specularity, as everything else.

149
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:34,439
Nothing really new there.

150
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:41,440
Reflectivity amounts so we can make it very reflective.

151
00:22:46,969 --> 00:22:59,450
The reflectivity is taken from real time
reflection probes that are placed in the world.

152
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:09,589
Let's see if I can bring this back up.

153
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,329
Glossiness.

154
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:16,939
So this was achieved by basically
stepping through different mipmaps

155
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:22,788
of the cube map reflection.

156
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:27,980
So you could have it very shiny, or not.

157
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,180
Fresnel

158
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:38,240
or BRDF (bidirectional reflectance distribution function),
as it is referred to as here

159
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:46,800
and two passes of normal maps that were
basically applied onto each other and merged.

160
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,928
Let me continue.

161
00:23:54,929 --> 00:23:56,210
So as you can see here,

162
00:23:56,211 --> 00:23:58,808
these are two comparisons that we did.

163
00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:06,319
On the left side we have the original
Maya shader, the Mental Ray shader.

164
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:16,569
On the right side, you can see the results
from the Unity adaptation of that shader.

165
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:22,798
These are basically spheres that we rendered
in in an array with different amounts of

166
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:32,509
reflectivity, specular and other properties.

167
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,970
Skin Rendering.

168
00:24:33,995 --> 00:24:35,495
This was actually--

169
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,520
One second, sorry...

170
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:49,219
The skin shader was derived from
the Mental Ray-inspired shader.

171
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:58,309
Since it wasn't able to do organic materials,
we tweaked it to actually do that.

172
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:03,285
As well as with the Maya shader, this one
also is very intuitive for the CG artists.

173
00:25:03,286 --> 00:25:11,579
Basically they have all the parameters that
are available in their 3D program.

174
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:18,390
That includes having three different skin layers, two
specular layers, and backscattering on the skin.

175
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:25,400
In some scenes you can see the sun
hitting the character from behind.

176
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:36,259
Then the ears, which are the thinnest
pieces of skin, are glowingly red.

177
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:43,260
That's basically the translucency
as the sun is penetrating the skin.

178
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:53,019
Instead of using the DirectX 11 tesselation, we actually
had a Catmull-Clark subdivided solution instead.

179
00:25:54,460 --> 00:26:00,179
The character artists are much more
acquainted with this kind of tesselation

180
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:07,180
and we were able to get much more
identical results by having that.

181
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:17,370
I'm going to demonstrate the skin as well.

182
00:26:23,595 --> 00:26:25,095
Just a minute...

183
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,920
Okay, let's open up the...

184
00:26:39,045 --> 00:26:42,845
So I can find a good spot to look at skin.

185
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,870
Here he comes flying.

186
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:46,895
They're about there...

187
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,420
There.

188
00:26:51,145 --> 00:26:56,645
Let's see if we can find him now in this shot.

189
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:15,390
He's already been tweaked a bit, so
he's a little bit green at the moment.

190
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:21,839
In that case if we adjust the
greenness back to a yellow color.

191
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:28,840
And close this so we can see better.

192
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:34,890
Give him a bit more yellow tint.

193
00:27:34,915 --> 00:27:35,915
Sorry.

194
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:44,510
I can increase or decrease the different influences

195
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:49,669
from the various layers of skin,

196
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:52,659
change their color,

197
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:56,178
tweak normals if that's necessary,

198
00:27:56,179 --> 00:28:00,269
the amount of blurriness of each layer,

199
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:03,589
and add AO (ambient occlusion) on top of that.

200
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:09,489
I don't think it's very visible unless it's in closeups.

201
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:13,269
Adjust the amount of backscattering on the skin,

202
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:18,298
how much it should saturate when
the sun is actually hitting it,

203
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:20,390
reflectivity amounts.

204
00:28:20,415 --> 00:28:22,915
So, let's see if we can--

205
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,940
Sorry.

206
00:28:24,965 --> 00:28:30,765
If we can decrease or increase that...

207
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:06,658
As you can see on the tip of the ear,
it's a little bit red and orange.

208
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:15,009
That's the backscattering that's showing there.

209
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:22,010
Let's see if we can bring that up.

210
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:33,810
I guess it's not visible on the screen.

211
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:46,579
Of course this one has, just like the Mental Ray
shader, two normal maps that are overlapping, basically.

212
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:51,359
One that gives the detail in the skin, the pores

213
00:29:51,360 --> 00:30:05,350
and one that supplies the bigger details,
such as a wrinkles and creases.

214
00:30:06,909 --> 00:30:12,639
To continue, next is hair and tesselation.

215
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,639
We use that for three
different characters.

216
00:30:16,665 --> 00:30:20,255
There is this old grandma that is driving the car,

217
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:23,599
there is the the bus driver,

218
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,969
and also the main character.

219
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:39,769
Apart from that we had a different variation
of the hair generation on slippers.

220
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:47,168
So, using DirectX 11 we were able to
generate hair and render it with tesselation.

221
00:30:47,169 --> 00:30:54,099
This basically allowed us to
sculpt any kind of hairstyle.

222
00:30:54,100 --> 00:31:00,459
The hair was placed in Unity by adding
emitter meshes to the character.

223
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:10,119
That was a separate mesh that just determined where, on what
location, and which faces of the character should have hair.

224
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:17,629
We applied it to the top of the hair
of the main character and eyebrows.

225
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:20,589
The grooming of the hair, the style...

226
00:31:20,615 --> 00:31:23,649
the hairstyle...

227
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:26,199
the bedhead as he wakes up.

228
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,919
His hair is pointing in various
directions and there's another

229
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:37,798
set of hair when he's going at full speed when the
hair is actually animated backwards and moving.

230
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:44,379
This was done in in a 3D program.

231
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:47,118
Specifically for this it was XSI,

232
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:57,209
where the character artists were able to set
up guide hairs to sculpt the hair as they liked.

233
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:06,010
So I will show the hair for you.

234
00:32:09,535 --> 00:32:11,535
Okay.

235
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:37,198
Bring back this, as flying through the alley.

236
00:32:37,299 --> 00:32:43,149
Good thing the rope wrapped around his leg.

237
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:45,129
Stop right there.

238
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:48,630
Now look at him.

239
00:32:54,894 --> 00:32:56,894
I'll close this.

240
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:07,759
He's a little bit shinier now since
we just changed the material.

241
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,769
So a close-up.

242
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:19,199
As you can see we cheated a bit with the shadows of the
hair by just painting it directly into the diffuse map.

243
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,239
That worked quite well.

244
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:36,260
We had a special solution for some close-ups where we just made
up a variant of the skin that was missing the painted shadows.

245
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,869
So this hair was able to LOD.

246
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:45,699
There were levels of detail of the hair depending on
the distance that were determined automatically.

247
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:49,279
So it goes from very detailed hair to

248
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:55,399
thicker and fewer strands of hair.

249
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,330
You can adjust the length.

250
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:08,198
Clumping, that's the grease in the hair that
basically ties the strands of hair together.

251
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:15,199
This causes a much more natural look.

252
00:34:17,439 --> 00:34:23,118
Various parameters such as noise,
to create a bit of irregularity

253
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,538
and wind animation speed.

254
00:34:25,539 --> 00:34:31,878
That's the movement that's happening
in the hair as he's going down the hill.

255
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:41,648
There's no advanced simulation for that hair,
it's basically just noise displacing the tesselation,

256
00:34:41,649 --> 00:34:46,549
the tesselated surfaces.

257
00:34:46,849 --> 00:34:59,708
You can play a bit with with the hair color I
think, to get an understanding of what we have.

258
00:34:59,709 --> 00:35:02,589
We added a fake rim to it.

259
00:35:03,589 --> 00:35:06,678
Let's see if I can demonstrate that so you can see.

260
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:09,198
Along the edges, there's a bit of red.

261
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:21,199
This rim helped us create fake lighting for the
hair that gave a bit more of a fuzzy look to it.

262
00:35:21,224 --> 00:35:25,224
Here we go, now you can see how it's...

263
00:35:42,989 --> 00:35:52,408
That's basically just scratching the surface
of all the things we can do with the hair.

264
00:35:52,409 --> 00:35:57,159
Now I'll show you how it worked
with the fur version of this also.

265
00:36:26,249 --> 00:36:32,648
This is the scene where he's going
down the hill and flying off.

266
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:39,198
Let's rewind and have a look at this.

267
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:46,199
Look at the slippers.

268
00:36:56,524 --> 00:37:01,324
Close this window to get a bit more space on the desktop.

269
00:37:02,699 --> 00:37:09,429
This is how they are very close up.

270
00:37:12,959 --> 00:37:23,639
You get somewhat similar types of shading as we
could do with physically-based material

271
00:37:23,669 --> 00:37:28,038
and some parameters basically just to control the hair.

272
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:40,298
So there's length, and that could make them very fuzzy.

273
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:43,409
Or...

274
00:37:45,409 --> 00:37:52,158
Control the clumping of those as
well, so you could get thicker hair.

275
00:37:52,159 --> 00:38:01,739
Color, some nice pink ones.

276
00:38:03,129 --> 00:38:10,129
And adjust the specularity,
the shine on the hairs, basically.

277
00:38:16,779 --> 00:38:19,888
Going back to this,

278
00:38:19,889 --> 00:38:21,878
The post-effects.

279
00:38:21,879 --> 00:38:26,938
As I mentioned earlier we had a lot
of post-effects applied to this

280
00:38:26,939 --> 00:38:33,249
I will shortly demonstrate how many there were
and what they actuallly did to the final shot.

281
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:40,248
The big things that we added to
this were depth of field and bokeh.

282
00:38:40,249 --> 00:38:44,879
That was specificially due to the
requirements of the CG studio.

283
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:52,448
This was combined with an anti-aliasing
that was very DoF, depth of field, aware.

284
00:38:52,449 --> 00:38:56,838
So it worked very nicely together
with the character and the hair.

285
00:38:56,839 --> 00:39:01,469
We were able to have depth of field
blur behind the hair of the character

286
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:10,078
without any obvious interference or artifacts.

287
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:14,999
We had two layers of high dynamic range
bloom placed on top of each other.

288
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:26,538
One worked basically like a bit of tone mapping and the
other one gave the glows around specular highlights.

289
00:39:26,539 --> 00:39:32,459
We had an RGB channel noise and grain,
which is not something extraordinary

290
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:37,478
but it was interesting to see that
these artists were using.

291
00:39:37,479 --> 00:39:51,968
Instead of having a global noise they were working with
the noise amounts differently in the various RGB channels.

292
00:39:51,969 --> 00:39:55,538
On top of that we added color
correction, the grading

293
00:39:55,539 --> 00:39:59,918
which we did with 3D lookup tables.

294
00:39:59,919 --> 00:40:06,919
So let me quickly demonstrate this.

295
00:40:29,389 --> 00:40:31,768
So you may recognize this scene.

296
00:40:31,769 --> 00:40:36,619
He is again flying,

297
00:40:38,149 --> 00:40:42,938
this time through a diner.

298
00:40:42,939 --> 00:40:48,680
So this is how it looks without the particle effects.

299
00:40:55,939 --> 00:41:00,299
Let's play it.

300
00:41:07,409 --> 00:41:21,739
I will do a breakdown now of the various post-effects
and you will be able to see how it was added on this.

301
00:41:22,709 --> 00:41:33,468
As you can see in this inspector these are all the
different types of components that we added on top.

302
00:41:33,469 --> 00:41:38,098
Camera jitter was something that we
added to camera at a very late stage

303
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:44,248
because it gave a bit more of a documentary
feel to it, a bit more lively camera.

304
00:41:44,249 --> 00:41:50,498
It's basically just randomly
offsetting the camera a little bit.

305
00:41:50,499 --> 00:41:59,768
Hardly noticeable but still gives a
much less artificial camera movement.

306
00:41:59,769 --> 00:42:01,368
Noise and grain,

307
00:42:01,369 --> 00:42:09,679
but I guess that's not very visible
up there on this big screen.

308
00:42:13,089 --> 00:42:17,018
There was an overlay

309
00:42:17,019 --> 00:42:23,898
light bleeding simulated with just a plain
texture that we put on top that was

310
00:42:23,899 --> 00:42:28,549
supposed to look like light actually
hit through the camera lens.

311
00:42:29,549 --> 00:42:34,038
The grading,

312
00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:36,158
the bloom,

313
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:39,458
second pass of bloom,

314
00:42:39,459 --> 00:42:45,318
the vignette, basically the darker areas
around the frame.

315
00:42:45,319 --> 00:42:46,978
Anti-aliasing,

316
00:42:46,979 --> 00:42:50,738
depth of field,

317
00:42:50,739 --> 00:42:57,108
screen space, or in fact we used
horizontally-based ambient occlusion,

318
00:42:57,109 --> 00:42:58,548
and blur.

319
00:42:58,549 --> 00:43:08,669
So this is how the shot looked completely untreated

320
00:43:11,319 --> 00:43:21,359
and this is how it ended
up looking in the final.

321
00:43:23,289 --> 00:43:25,508
Going back to this,

322
00:43:25,509 --> 00:43:28,089
we had some volumetric explosions in the end.

323
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:36,688
We initially thought about doing this with fluids,
but it just proved to be slightly too expensive

324
00:43:36,689 --> 00:43:39,959
and a bit too difficult for us to actually control.

325
00:43:40,969 --> 00:43:47,209
Instead, we went for a distance
field-ray marching variant.

326
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:54,568
This is just a volume rendering technique that is able
to process volume data instead of surface data

327
00:43:54,569 --> 00:43:57,490
like a ray caster does.

328
00:43:59,409 --> 00:44:06,378
On top of this, as you can see in the
bottom right there we had volumes.

329
00:44:06,379 --> 00:44:11,429
These volumes were given
its surface, this pyroclastic surface

330
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:21,118
by offsetting the various parts of the
original sphere with Perlin noise.

331
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:29,900
The shade, or the color, the value of the
surface was based on the displacement distance.

332
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:40,879
So the further the distance was from the center of the
fireball, or the sphere, the darker and grayer it became.

333
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:50,088
So at the very center it's warm and orange
and it gradually gets darker and grayer.

334
00:44:50,089 --> 00:44:52,938
This gives a smoky effect.

335
00:44:52,939 --> 00:44:58,538
These volumes unexpectedly worked
very well with world geometry.

336
00:44:58,539 --> 00:45:02,808
They fit in nicely and we were able to wrap
them around corners of houses or buildings

337
00:45:02,809 --> 00:45:08,398
or fit the character to blend
very nicely with them or busses,

338
00:45:08,399 --> 00:45:12,128
as in this shot.

339
00:45:12,129 --> 00:45:14,944
Also the particles work very fine with that.

340
00:45:14,945 --> 00:45:19,259
Initially we added smoke particles
that were combined with this effect

341
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:27,608
but the end and we ended up not using them because
they didn't add as much as we anticipated.

342
00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:33,838
Also, I should note that this effect could could be lit

343
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:38,348
and therefore also have ambient occlusion added to it.

344
00:45:38,349 --> 00:45:41,748
So we've got a very defined surface to this

345
00:45:41,749 --> 00:45:48,749
I will demonstrate how they appear.

346
00:45:48,774 --> 00:45:51,774
Right here...

347
00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:01,599
Just a minute...

348
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:14,031
This is the effect.

349
00:46:14,057 --> 00:46:16,198
Boom!

350
00:46:16,199 --> 00:46:20,048
He flies off.

351
00:46:20,049 --> 00:46:22,978
There's the fireball in the background.

352
00:46:22,979 --> 00:46:27,169
So I will show how this is made.

353
00:46:27,194 --> 00:46:29,194
So let's get rid of everything

354
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:35,219
and then let's pick out the effect.

355
00:46:40,744 --> 00:46:46,044
Actually, let's bring it back, in fact.

356
00:47:02,509 --> 00:47:11,348
The user is able to control this by
just applying it to primitive spheres.

357
00:47:11,349 --> 00:47:14,438
It works basically like this.

358
00:47:14,439 --> 00:47:16,978
This was a sphere originally

359
00:47:16,979 --> 00:47:21,368
I think if you look at it through a
wireframe it's not even rendered

360
00:47:21,369 --> 00:47:28,329
as it's not typical geometric data.

361
00:47:28,399 --> 00:47:31,949
Then we could scale it, I think.

362
00:47:32,949 --> 00:47:36,449
Or not, possibly.

363
00:47:48,519 --> 00:47:53,478
That's basically how that worked.

364
00:47:53,479 --> 00:48:02,858
I'm running out of time here, so I will skip
these examples that I added towards the end.

365
00:48:02,859 --> 00:48:07,248
But feel free to contact me and I
will show them to you after this talk.

366
00:48:07,249 --> 00:48:13,109
If you're interested in seeing
them, I will be around for a while.

367
00:48:14,449 --> 00:48:19,388
Thank you to everyone involved both
from Passion Pictures and nVidia

368
00:48:19,389 --> 00:48:27,380
I hope you enjoyed the talk and, as I said, feel free to get in
touch and I will explain more about the procedure for you.

369
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:30,005
Thank you.
